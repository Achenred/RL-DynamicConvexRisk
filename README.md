# Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Convex Risk Measures

This Github repository regroups the Python code to run the actor-critic algorithm and replicate the experiments given in the paper [Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Convex Risk Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13414).

Thank you for your interest in my research work. Myself and Prof. Sebastian Jaimungal are currently working on improving the code -- the full implementation will be available around the end of January 2022.

If you have any additional enquiries, please reach out to myself at [anthony.coache@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:anthony.coache@mail.utoronto.ca).
